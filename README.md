# GoalSetter
This is a programme which allows user-specific logins in order to track a user's goals and obstacles surrounding a mental health struggle. The format of the project is similar to that of my previous 'shopping list' project however I have altered the form slightly to solve a new problem! This will be the first of a series of projects I am working on which will help to combat issues in which those of specific mental illnesses struggle with. 

An example of which this project can be used is for a user which struggles with Schizophrenic avolition (i.e. an inability to part-take in goal directed behaviour) this webapp could be used in such a way:

1) Title: Avolition
2) Description: I struggle with setting goals and following through
3) Goal: To obtain an A on my mid-term exam 
4) Obstacles: * Whatever the user's obstacles may be *

Note: Schizophrenia is defined as a serious mental disorder which is characterised by severe disruptions in psychological functions which affects thoughts, perception, language, emotion and a loss of contact with reality. Although this may be an extreme use-case example I hope to iterate over this project to create a better UX for people with different backgrounds and cognitions.
